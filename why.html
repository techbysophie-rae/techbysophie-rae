        <h2>Why I prefer dogs over cats</h2>

            <p>
                I prefer dogs over cats because they can love so much more they keep you for the most part in shape and they don't bring flees into the house. I had 2 dogs of my own a white fluffy one and a golden riterver black laborador mix and they were some of the most fun I had when I had them.
